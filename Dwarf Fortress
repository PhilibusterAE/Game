Memories
    8 short-term memory slots
    8 long-term memory slots
    During a year a dwarf will dwell on 8 events with the strongest emotions (negative or positive) and receive additonal stress change (+/-)
    After a year a short-term memory becomes a long-term memory if it is stronger than one of the existing long-term memories
    Long-term memories persist forever and periodically apply a stress modifier unless they are overwritten by a stronger memory or become a core memory
    Memories are grouped by category and only the strongest memory of each category get a slot

Stress
    Dwarves have a stress score. whenever a dwarf experiences an emotion or revisit a long-term memory a ceratin number of points is added or reemoved from the stress score
        stresss score determines mood
    Stress slowly returns to a neutral point overtime
    3 personality traits determine propensity for stress
        Bravery
            How fast stress accumulates
        Stress Vulnerability
            How high the stress score must be before breaking
        Anxiety
            How fast stress returns to the mean
    Some experiences have the same effect on any dwarf, some have varibale effect based on variables
    strength of emotions varies based on personality

        dwarves that are in adacent squares may chat if they are idle but will njot chat if they are busy with an activity like drinking eating or doing a job
        As dwarves accumulate chats they form opinions of each other based on compatibility scores
            similar personalities or skills lead to friendship
            they will become aquaintences then either long-term aquaintences or friends depending on compatibility
            grudges may form if compatibility is too low
                only maojr differences in personality result in grudges, skills have no impact
            Extra high compatibilty can lead to becoming lovers if they chat enough
                can eventually lead to marriage given enough chats
                orientation must match
                must be adult
                no age gap too large
                not too closely related
    It is possible for two dwarves to have different opiniions of each other
        due to having their opinions determined based on seperate variables of their individual personalities and emotions
            (would need to add system where if thereis a mismatch to have certain dynamics with that)
    Mechanics
        1.Relations are formed the first time a unit is idle or socializing next to another unit*
        2.When a relationship rank hits 15, a friendship or grudge is formed, depending on compatibility.
        3.When the rank is around 40, if the units are friends and are romantically inclined, they become lovers. A range of 31-42 has been observed, probably influenced by one or more personality facets.
        4.When the rank hits 50, and the units are lovers, they can get married.
        5.Talking to grudges can really spike a unit's stress level (700+ per day), depending on personality.
        6.Socializing units can increase rank with busy adjacent units if they don't move (tested with pumpstacks, libraries, and temples).
