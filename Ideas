Dynamic attitudes to track peoples opinions and familiarity with you
    -Heavily encourage stealth gameplay/snooping
    -people with strong connections (work/relationships) will sometimes share info causing spread of suspicion among groups
    -mechanic in conversations for sharing/not sharing name
